FYI: I couldn't get my css to link up sooo it's all in the html files 

Paige - I like the look of your webiste - simple but still visually appealing. Your code is all very clean, easy to read, and simple. Nice job! If you want some help moving your styling into a css file and getting it linked up, let me know (no promises, but I may be able to help) - I had some trouble with the file path initially, but then eventually got it to work. That was useful because you can throw classes on everything and then have a single css that styles both of your html files. You might also consider adding a max width/min width to your page so that formatting doesn't get quite as wonky when you change the page dimensions.

Summer: Jenny! This is great! so fun to look through! 

Michael: I love the fact that you went with a shadow background on the heading and everything lines up it's easy on the eyes.
